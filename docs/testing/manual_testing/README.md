# Manual testing

We aim to automate as much as we possibly can. Still manual testing is really important for Quality Assurance. 

Here you'll find our manual testing scripts. When developing a new feature you can add your own that provide the proper steps to properly test it. 


## Running Darksidewalletd tests

1. clone [lightwalletd](https://github.com/zcash/lightwalletd.git)
